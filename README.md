# HART ISLAND GEOCODING

## Objective

The Hart Island dataset is a dataset of individuals buried at Hart Island. For each deceased person, it lists the location where they passed away. The objective of this project is to geocode those locations, so we may be able to see where those who have passed away came from.

### Packages Used

library(tidyverse) - dataframe and mutations
library(janitor) - cleaning the column names
library(ggmap) - geocoding
